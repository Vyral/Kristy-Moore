Thank you to everyone who came to our recent Client Appreciation Party\! We had such a blast competing in axe throwing and driving those blazing fast go-karts\! You can see a quick recap of the fun in this short video.

Congratulations to Adam Bever, Bill Ramsey, and Chris Keck for winning the top three spots in the Go-Kart races and Emily Bever’s team for winning the axe throwing competition.  Thank you to Smoking Kow BBQ for the amazing food\! It was definitely a hit\! We are looking forward to seeing you at our next event\! Stay tuned\!
