<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are three basic tips to ensure your home sells for more money.</em></p>

If you’re a homeowner who’s thinking about selling your house, there are a few basic things that you need to do with your property before you sell it. We won’t go through the whole list—that’s part of our room-by-room review—but we can give you a few helpful tips.

**3\. Lighting**. Do you feel better or worse on a gloomy day? Most people would say worse. Keep in mind that buyers make decisions based on emotions, so you want them to feel good when they view your home.&nbsp;

Updating or improving your lighting is a cost-effective way to make sure your buyers feel happy and warm when they leave your house. That means more than just your light fixtures—it also includes your bulbs. Update your fixtures and replace your fluorescent bulbs with LED or incandescent ones. The good, old-fashioned white light makes all the difference. You can also install mirrors and open the blinds to channel as much natural light as possible to illuminate all the space in your home.

**2\. Curb appeal.** When people come up to your house, what does it look like? Does it look as though you haven’t taken care of it in the last 10 years, or does it look like every single thing is on point? To make the exterior of your home look its best, power wash it, caulk your windows, remove mold, seal cracks in your driveway, and spruce up your landscaping. That will help make a great first impression on potential buyers who pull up to your home.

**1\. Cleaning.** Even if your house is dated, you’ll almost certainly get buyers for your property if it’s impeccably clean. No one wants to buy dirty baseboards or moldy siding. Unclean homes put doubts into a buyer’s mind about whether you’ve properly maintained it, and they might suspect deeper issues with the home beyond its cleanliness. Deep clean your property as though the president were coming over. Touching up your paint job can also give your home a nice clean feel to it.

These are just a few of the simple, low-cost tips we have to help you get your home in market-ready condition. If you’d like to schedule a room-by-room review before you sell your home, or if you have any questions, reach out to us. We’d love to help.
