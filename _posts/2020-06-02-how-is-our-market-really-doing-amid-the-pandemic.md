Here’s where are market’s really at, according to the latest numbers.

Today I’ll answer the No. 1 question on everyone’s minds: How is our real estate market really doing? From a supply and demand standpoint, the market is healthy. Now that we’re into June, though, that can change quickly, so I’ll go over the latest stats from each marketplace we cover. Specifically, I’ll share the number of sales, the absorption rate, and inventory of each area and explain what they indicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch it in its entirety or use these timestamps to browse specific points at your leisure:&nbsp;**

0:48—Northern Virginia&nbsp;

4:23—Washington, D.C.&nbsp;

5:50—Montgomery County, Maryland&nbsp;

8:03—If you want or need to sell this year, do it now

9:12—Wrapping thing sup

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
