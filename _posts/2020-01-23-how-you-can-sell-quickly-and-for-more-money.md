  market.

One of our wonderful clients, Gwen Saxby, joined us recently to talk about her experience working with us. She was relocating and had to use her relocation company's Realtors, but she was also allowed to bring us on. When her relocation company told her she couldn’t list at the $580,000 that we recommended, she had to list it at $559,900. However, on the second weekend, **we got multiple offers and ended up selling it for $577,000, close to our original recommended price**. Gwen says she is now our client for life.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to hear from you.
