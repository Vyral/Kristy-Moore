Today I’m joined by Harley Dufek, a mentor of mine and founder of the Harley Realtor Group, to discuss how to bulletproof your real estate transaction as a seller.&nbsp;

Doing this, and by extension creating a better client experience, starts with getting a pre-inspection. **For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of the conversation above where we explain why this is so you can jump to certain sections at your leisure:**
