We love to tell stories about the things that we experience in real estate. I think they’re a really good indication of what happens when you work with someone who doesn’t have the experience you need to avoid costly mistakes when buying or selling a home. Today, my partner Harley \_\_\_\_\_ and I have a story of our own to share that involves one of the properties we bought and renovated. There was a major hiccup in the inspection, but we were fully prepared for it.
