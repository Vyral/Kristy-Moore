My partner Harley Dufek and I love to tell stories about our experiences working in real estate. Many of these stories include valuable lessons about what can happen when buyers and sellers work with the wrong agent before coming to us. And a subpar professional is just one of the costly mistakes a person can make during the real estate process. In today's message, Harley and I will share our own story, which focuses on a property we once bought and renovated. During the process of purchasing this property, we encountered a major hiccup in the inspection period. Thankfully, we were fully prepared for it.
