Home staging is more than just putting nice furniture into a living space to brighten it up. It’s also about recommending what needs to be done to your property, aesthetically speaking, to appeal to a broad demographic of homebuyers.

When we do a room-by-room review of a home, we go into each room of your house and make recommendations about what needs to be done not only to maximize your home’s price, but also to appeal to the types of buyers who will be looking at your property.&nbsp;

For instance, if you have a lot of floral drapery, green carpeting, and other design choices that date back to the 90s or before, we’d recommend what you could do to inexpensively upgrade the property and redesign it for today’s homebuyers.

That said, today we’ll take some time to get into the details of what staging means and how it can benefit your home.
