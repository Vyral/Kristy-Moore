Have you ever wondered whether open houses actually work? Many sellers aren’t thrilled about the idea of letting neighbors and strangers alike into their home, but is it worth it?&nbsp;

Actually, the answer is complicated. While less than 1% of homes sell as a direct result of a buyer visiting an open house, this time-tested real estate technique can still be beneficial when executed properly.&nbsp;

This is because open houses give sellers the opportunity to really "hype up" their listing. Unlike during showings, when buyers have the opportunity to peruse a house on their own, open houses let them see exactly how much competition they’re up against. And when consumers see that someone else is interested in something they want, your listing becomes a hot commodity.&nbsp;

**We’ll delve deeper into the efficacy of open houses in the video above, so be sure to follow along to learn more.**
